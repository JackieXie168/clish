/**
\defgroup tinyrl "Tiny Readline Library"
@{

This library provides a simple replacement of the "readline" functionality.

The readline interface and implementation has some fundamental flaws when
it comes to try and run it within a single memory space envrioment. e.g. vxWorks
- The use of global variables prevents multiple sessions from co-existing.
- The comprehensiveness of the library makes it large, and it contains 
  more features than are needed in an embedded system.
- It relies on other (large) libraries which are not typically available on an
  embedded system e.g. termcap.
