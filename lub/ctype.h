\brief The ANSI-C standard <ctype.h> interface works fine for strings 
containing characters encoded with the ASCII 7-bit coding. However 
when you use characters outside this range things start to get ambiguous. 

The default manner in which to represent a string in C is to use a 
"char *". (NB. this is a signed type) The interfaces presented 
in <ctype.h> take signed integers. When a character greater than 128 is
passed as a "char" to isspace() (e.g. the british pound sign "£") then 
a negative value is passed into the function/macro. A typical
implementation (e.g. VxWorks) may use the passed argument as an offset
into a lookup table, negative values in this case cause problems...

This utility provides an interface which avoids this ambiguity by passing 
"char" characters directly rather than converting to "int".

This component currently only contains those operations which are required
by the current CLISH/LUB implementations. It can be extended on an as needed 
basis.
