/**
\defgroup clish "CLI Shell" Library
@{

This library provides the core functionality for a shell to implement a 
CISCO-like user interface. The look and feel is fully defined by a set of XML
files which are loaded when the shell starts up.

The schema for these XML files can be found in 
http://clish.sourceforge.net/XMLSchema/clish.xsd
