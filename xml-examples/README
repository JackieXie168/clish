This directory contains some example XML files which indicate some
of what can be acheived with the CLISH library.

The action fields are 'sh' scripts and were developed and
tested on a cygwin system so some  of the command options to
things like "ping" may be different on different systems. 
(you should only need to change the ACTION tag to get them to work...) 

To use these files set CLISH_PATH to point to this directory and 
launch clish.

\note
Thanks to Tom Williams who gave me the basis for the
"clock" command example.
